\section{Materials and Methods}
This section has materials and methods
\subsection{Materials}
CF-ABS is the material.
\subsection{Methods}
There are several experimental methods to determine the material properties. One fancy method is discussed by Gholinezad et al \cite{gholinezhad2022non}.
Einstein's equation relating mass to energy is shown in Equation \ref{eqn: einstien}.
\begin{equation}
                                                   \label{eqn: einstien}
                                                   E = mc^2
                                                   \end{equation}
\newline
where,\newline
$E$ = energy\newline
$m$ = mass\newline
$c$ = speed of light in vacuum \newline

Did Equation \ref{eqn: einstien} changed the world for good? What effect does this equation have on our day to day life?
