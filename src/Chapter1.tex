\section{Introduction}

Hello! This is the introduction of the chapter. We will introduce things and stuffs that will be amazing. The introduction
will be one of a kind. Hold back on to your seats, relax, and enjoy the ride.
Here goes a random citation to show that citation is possible \cite{blom2006detection}.

Equations can be written as well $E=mc^2\label{eq:mass_energy}$. Equation written this way does not show equation number.
Equation \ref{eq:mass_energy} relates mass to energy.

To properly write equation, an equation section needs to be set up. Equation \ref{eq:equilibrium} shows equilibrium equation for solid mechanics.
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{ji,j}-F=0 \label{eq:equilibrium}
\end{equation}

Constitutive equations are shown in Equation \ref{eq:constitutive}.

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}.\epsilon_{kl}   \label{eq:constitutive}
\end{equation}
